# github-repo-searcher

# TODO

- do not show the ssh, maybe show the repo description instead?
- remove clipboard.rs and menu.rs and instead always open in github 
- show entered prompt at bottom after >
- move [100/100] showing into the line and use a better line character which has no gaps

# LATER

add gitlab as well
